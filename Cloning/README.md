# Cloning/copying agents

## What is the meaning of "Clone" in OpenAI-Agents-SDK?.
In the **OpenAI Agents SDK,** clone means **to create a duplicate of an agent.**
But it’s more than just making a copy — cloning also allows you to **customize the new agent** by changing certain properties like **name, instructions, model, etc.**

## When we use the "Clone"?
### 1. Multiple variations of the same agent
   **For example,** you create an agent that writes in a **Pirate style.**
   Now you also want the *same agent* to write in a **Robot style,** while keeping all other settings the same.
   In this case, you can use ***clone().***

### 2. Reusing base configuration
   If you don’t want to repeat the same **model, tools, and setup again and again,**
   you can create a ***base agent*** and then *clone it* with small changes as needed.

### 3. Experimentation / A-B Testing
   If you want to compare how the ***same model behaves with different instructions,***
   you can clone the agent and *create multiple variations for testing.*

### BENEFITS OF CLONE!!...
1. **Time saving** – no need to rewrite the entire code again.
2. **Consistency** – create multiple versions from one base agent, all following the same structure.
3. **Flexibility** – easily change small things like the agent’s name, tone, or instructions.
